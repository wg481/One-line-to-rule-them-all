# W h a t ?
Yep, it's another wg481 special: one line of code that calculates compound interest.

Prints a string that is a float rounded to the second decimal place of a bunch of floats that rely on numerical inputs lovingly put together in the compound interest formula.

# Math lesson?
F(t) = P + (1 + (r / n)) ^ (n * t)

* F(t) = yield after t years.
* P = principal value
* r = interest rate
* n = times compounded per year
* t = years
